            <h2>Would you like to share your datasets with the cardiovascular community via COPaKB?</h2>
            <p>
               We welcome you to share your datasets and explore them with our bioinformatics tools. With your consent, your raw mass spectral data will be analyzed with dedicated software packages (<a href="http://fields.scripps.edu/prolucid/">ProLuCID</a> and <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12643522">DTASelect</a>). The analysis results will be incorporated into the existing knowledgebase with the acknowledgement of your contributions. We can also highlight your publication(s) on the COPaKB website. We are committed to advocate your science. Please email us at <a href="mailto:info@heartproteome.org">info@heartproteome.org</a> to coordinate this collaborative effort. Thank you for joining us in this knowledge-building process.
